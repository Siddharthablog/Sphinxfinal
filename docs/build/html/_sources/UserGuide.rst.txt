.. _Powering On a Platform:

Powering On a Platform
**********************

The powering on platform operation is equivalent to pressing the physical power switch.
This operation can only be performed if the platform is in a powered-off state. This option
is disabled if the platform is already powered on.

**Prerequisite:** The platform is powered off.

To power on a platform, perform the following steps:

   1. On the ClearPath Forward vSphere Plug-in user interface, go to the list of objects, and select the platform that you want to power on.

   2. From the **Actions** drop-down menu, click **Power ON.**

.. _Powering Off a Platform:

Powering Off a Platform
***********************

Powering off is an unorderly shutdown of the platform. This is equivalent to switching off
the computer by pressing the power button. The platform is turned off without an orderly
shutdown of its partition images and guest operating systems.

To power off a platform, perform the following steps:

   1. On the ClearPath Forward vSphere Plug-in user interface, go to the list of objects and select the platform that you want to power off.

   2. From the **Actions** drop-down menu, click **Power OFF.**


.. _Performing Soft Restart on a Platform:

Performing Soft Restart on a Platform
**************************************

Soft restart is to shutdown of the platform and partitions followed by a restart. Soft restart
is equivalent to clicking Start and then clicking the Shutdown and Restart options in a
computer running on the Windows operating system.

To soft restart a platform, perform the following steps:

   1. On the ClearPath Forward vSphere Plug-in user interface, go to the list of objects, and select the platform that you want to soft restart.

   2. From the **Actions** drop-down menu, click Soft **Restart.**


.. _Performing Soft Shutdown on a Platform:

Performing Soft Shutdown on a Platform
***************************************

The soft shutdown operation is an orderly shutdown of the platform, and is also known as
graceful shutdown. Soft shutdown is equivalent to clicking Start and then clicking the
Shutdown and Ok options in a computer running on the Windows operating system.
You can shutdown a platform, if it is in a powered-on state.

To soft shutdown a platform, perform the following steps:

   1. On the ClearPath Forward vSphere Plug-in user interface, go to the list of objects, and select the platform that you want to shutdown.

   2. From the **Actions** drop-down menu, click Soft **Shutdown.**


.. _Viewing the Related Objects of a Platform:

Viewing the Related Objects of a Platform
-------------------------------------------

To view the related objects of a platform, perform the following steps:

   1. Expand the **Fabric** list, and click **Platforms.**
   
      The Platforms page appears with the platform details.
   2. Select the platform for which you want to view the related objects.
   3. Click the **Related Objects** tab.
